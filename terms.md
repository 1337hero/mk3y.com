**Cycling Friendly**

Cycling as a hobby or commuting has experienced a boom in recent years, ever since the 2012 Olympics ignited a passion in it for so many, however, not all hotels in London are too enthusiastic about cyclists traipsing through their entrance halls dripping in sweat with a muddy bike in tow. 

Fortunately for all of you who are brave enough to cycle in London while your stay, Docklands Lodge is the place. 

We welcome cyclists, and we’re always here to make sure you get a good night’s sleep before a day on two wheels.

You can safely lock your bike away in one of our allocated bike-hut when you are not using it allowing you to relax and enjoy your time with us. We will even keep your bike safe for you when you’re not out riding.

Bikes are closely monitored by 24-hour security cameras.
