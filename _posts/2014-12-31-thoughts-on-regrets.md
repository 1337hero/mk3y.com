Regret is something we all experience from time to time.

It feels since I hit 32 that I reflect on regrets more often than not. A lot has happened this year, and I still have many things I regret no accomplishing. For all I have accomplished, it still feels like I haven't accomplished much at all.

I have big plans for my family for the year 2015. But as I think about what needs to get done, I regret all that I haven't accomplished.

This year, I failed to get my weight back under control. It's fluctuated all year, from 170lbs to 205lbs. I've failed to meet my goals and deadline for this site. Failed to get my freelance business back off the ground. Failed to get our blog BoldAndAdventurous off the ground beyond two posts.

Regrets has a way of keeping you from accomplishing things if you spend to much time dwelling on your failures. Spending time on regrets prevents you from moving forward.

Rather than focusing my energies to dust off my feet, and get things done. I'm spending my energy regretting what is not done.

With the start of the new year, I want to refocus my efforts, to not dwell on regrets. To focus on getting things done.

Here's to the New Year and saying good bye to regrets.
