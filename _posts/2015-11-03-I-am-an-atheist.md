This post has been in the works for some time. I came to the personal conclusion several months ago that I am an atheist. It feels appropriate to elaborate on how I arrived here for friends and family who are curious. And those concerned with my soul.

## My History

My home wasn’t a religious one growing up. I grew up with a single mother and no father present in my life.

For the most part, my childhood was free of any religious indoctrination.

We identified with Christianity because it was mainstream and because of family traditions. We celebrated Christmas as the birth of Christ. Easter as the Resurrection and gave a prayer of thanks on Thanksgiving. 

We didn’t attend regular Sunday services, though. We weren’t members of any particular church or denomination. 

## My path to Christianity

My life up until my early 20’s resembled a secularly progressive one.

In 2004, I was terminated from a job as a contractor for the Navy/USMC.

This event and a cumulative of other bad choices forced me to re-evaluate the direction of my life.

My ego proceeded to implode over the following months as I struggled to make ends meet.

A former coworker reached out to me at about this time. He gave me a book called, “Maximized Manhood”. This book exposed me to some traditional Christian ideas about manhood. At the time, the book resonated with explaining why my life was in disarray.

He invited me to his church, the first time I had ever gone to a church in my young adult life. And that first Sunday, it felt as though the pastor of this church was speaking to me with his sermon.

It was a talk about manhood and it resonated. 

As a boy without a father growing up, I had no real idea how to be a man in my adult life.

Here was that answer, Christianity would teach me how to be a man and fix the brokenness in my life.

God was my father. I was no longer fatherless. And Jesus Christ was my savior, who had paid for my sins on the cross. 

## My Faith

Over time, I became more involved in my church and felt that God’s calling on my life was men’s ministry.

My faith played a daily part in my life and my identity. I had found a community to belong to, a purpose for being. 

Daily Bible study and prayer became ritual for me. As time went on, I developed an interest in better understanding my faith. Topics of theology and creationism were of particular interest.

At that time, I felt and believed that I had a deep personal relationship with Christ. I had a rich prayer life and felt assured of my salvation. I had been baptized and received the Holy Spirit and the gifts of the spirit.

## My First Questioning

I spent six years of my adult life at the church my former co-worker introduced me to.

But the church collapsed when it came to light that the pastor was having an affair with the youth pastors wife. And that this was not the first time this behavior had occurred.

This was a blow at first. I questioned what I had placed my faith in, and began to ask, how I knew what I was believing was correct.

It is at this time I began a regular discussion on the topic of faith with an old friend.

He exposed me to some of the problems with my church’s teachings of the “prosperity gospel”. And pointed me towards some more of the traditional aspects of theology.

What happened here are a couple rationalizations.

I convinced myself that God is still God, and Jesus is his son. The Bible is true. But the teachings I followed were wrong. 

A doubling down on my faith began, and a journey into the young reformed movement started.

## A second questioning

In 2011, my wife and I moved to Florida. After searching for a church home, and a few that didn’t fit, we found one in Saint Petersburg. Life Bridge Church seemed like the place for us.

From the pulpit’s the pastor preached a reformed approach to Christianity. And I began to read books from authors and pastors like RC Sprout and John Piper. 

And for a time, we were happy and grew in our faith. 

That was until the realization that Life Bridge Church is a cult. 

A few families at this time were having doubts about the church, and somehow my wife and I got sucked into this. We were subject to humiliation, insults, harassment and flat out spiritual abuse.

We left that church. And we moved from Saint Petersburg to Clearwater just to get away.

This event left us both hurting. And we have been without a church ever since.

I was angry and bitter for about a year after the incident. I spent a great deal of time praying and working it out with God. This lead me to a few questions that kept popping up in my head.

**Why do I believe what I believe?**

and

**How do I know what I believe is correct?**

## Realizations
With so many denominations, and so many interruptions of the Bible. Each convinced they’ve got the correct revelation, and their interruption is right. How does one answer this question without blind faith? 

Faith is the thing that causes one to abandon all reason and logic. The more I tried to look at this logically, the more and more it kept leading me to the same conclusion. 

I looked at the history of the church, world history, other religions, and science. The evidence, when taken in, is overwhelming.

This lead me to the inevitable realization that the God of the Bible most likely does not exist.

I say “most likely”; because I like Richard Dawkins 7 Point Scale laid out in the God Delusion.

Wikipedia describes it as follows:

1. Strong theist. 100 per cent probability of God. In the words of C.G. Jung: “I do not believe, I know.” 
2. De facto theist. Very high probability but short of 100 per cent. “I don’t know for certain, but I strongly believe in God and live my life on the assumption that he is there.”
3. Leaning towards theism. Higher than 50 per cent but not very high. “I am very uncertain, but I am inclined to believe in God.”
4. Completely impartial. Exactly 50 per cent. “God’s existence and non-existence are exactly equiprobable.”
5. Leaning towards atheism. Lower than 50 per cent but not very low. “I do not know whether God exists but I’m inclined to be skeptical.”
6. De facto atheist. Very low probability, but short of zero. “I don’t know for certain but I think God is very improbable, and I live my life on the assumption that he is not there.”
7. Strong atheist. “I know there is no God, with the same conviction as Jung knows there is one.”

Wiki also adds: “Dawkins self-identified as a ‘6’

For a short time after my realization, I found myself as ‘5’ on the scale. 

But I have since moved towards ‘6’ as I have given it more thought.

There is just no strong evidence to suggest I believe otherwise.

## Conclusion

Atheism is quite liberating. But at the same time, this journey has brought a small sense of sadness and some anger.  It has also humbled me in some ways, and I have some regrets about previously held positions.

Sadness at the energy spent on church and other “Christian” pursuits. Time and energy that instead could of have gone towards my dreams and goals. Not to mention lost income given away to churches.

Regret that I held beliefs like “Homosexuals are deviants and shouldn’t be allowed to be married.”

Regret that many of the beliefs I held as a direct result in my belief in Christianity, directly or indirectly contribute to the oppression and abuse of others.

Anger that I was niece enough to believe in things that seem obvious now. But at the same time, a deep understanding of why and how others believe what they believe.

Anger that those beliefs that I held, do in fact inflict massive societal ill. Cause harm to millions of people in various types of ways. And in some cases are holding our society as a whole back.

But in this, there is also great joy. And a new view on life and it’s meaning. It feels richer and more beautiful than before. Rather than living my life for some final reward, I live in the here and the now. The present moment. There is no fear of uncertainty, no fear of hell fire. No fear or worry about whether I have the right theology.

I want to close with a quote by Christopher Hitchens

> “Death is certain, replacing both the siren-song of Paradise and the dread of Hell. Life on this earth, with all its mystery and beauty and pain, is then to be lived far more intensely: we stumble and get up, we are sad, confident, insecure, feel loneliness and joy and love.”
