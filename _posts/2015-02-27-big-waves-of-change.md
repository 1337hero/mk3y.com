In 64 days my family is hitting the road, and moving from Florida. And in 32 days our second daughter will enter the world. 

Where are we moving to? Enter: [BoldandAdventurous.com](http://boldandadventurous.com) - I’ve always had a passion for the outdoors and adventure. For a few years now we’ve toyed with the idea of selling everything we own and traveling the country. But it always seemed, unrealistic, until now. 

When our first daughter was born, my wife and I began to reevaluate the direction of our lives. One word kept surfacing in my mind, over and over. 

###MEDICORE.

We didn’t want to just live for the weekend, ship our kids off to day care and do the suburbia thing. 

During my wife’s maternity leave it became clear she did not want to go back to work. I was completely against shipping our child off to some day care. We were in agreement, she’d stay home.

My wife however, still wanted to earn money. Being in tech, I found a job on [WeWorkRemotely.com](http://weworkremotely.com) with [Basecamp](http://basecamp.com). Which to my surprise, my wife landed.

After a trip to Oregon for two weeks we knew that we wanted more than anything to start pursuing our dreams. For us, that meant TRAVEL. But now we where more confident in taking risks to get there.

The idea was to travel the country while living in an  Airstream. Going and seeing whatever we wanted at whatever pace we chose.

Now that dream is becoming or reality. We purchased a truck, and bought our Airstream.

This month, the company I work for agreed to let me transition into a full time remote position. It’s been a huge relief to us in transitioning to this new lifestyle.

One of the biggest challenges I was facing was solving the issue of; A. Going back to freelancing B. Find a remote job - All while sticking to our time table and handling all the other things we need to get done. To be honest, I don't think I could revive my freelance business while doing everything else.

But the fact is, I took a risk. I told my company I was planning to move. We knew one of two outcomes was possible. They'd let me go remote or I'd be out of a job.

But you know, safety is an illusion and you're always one accident away from losing your employment anyways.

Take the risks, and have a little faith. Things have a way of coming together.

So that's the big waves of change coming my way. It's also part of the reason I've begun to neglect my blog again.

I expect that to all change once we are on the road. And that my time will shift for new projects and new adventures.

Until then.
