Just recently I migrated this website from Wordpress to [Github pages](1) using [Jekyll](2). To date I am very pleased with the transition. 

Over time, I grew to really dislike how bloated Wordpress had become. The WYSIWYG editor seems to vomit random HTML onto your page with no control over its syntax. The plugin environment is whole story unto itself. You'd better cross your fingers and hope the person who wrote the PHP did so in a secure and efficient manner. 

Having to constantly install security updates every other week just became one more annoyance to deal with. Backing up WordPress is itself a pain, that always left me wondering and guessing. And let's not even discuss site performance issues with WordPress.

So when I learned about using Jekyll with Github pages from my coworker [@Joshtronic](3), it seemed like a great alternative. Jekyll is a Ruby based gem that compiles down into flat static files. Its simplicity makes backups easier and avoids all the common security concerns caused by running dynamic websites. Writing posts in Markdown is fast and efficient.

The fact that GitHub provides [free hosting for Jekyll blogs](http://pages.github.com/) is just icing on the cake. 

So I made the jump to Jekyll. Migrated my old posts from WordPress to Markdown, and my comments to Disqus.
