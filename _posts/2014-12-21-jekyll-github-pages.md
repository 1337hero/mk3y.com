Just recently I migrated this website from Wordpress to [Github pages](1) using [Jekyll](2). To date I am very pleased with the transition. 

So why ditch WordPress?

Over time, I grew to really dislike how bloated Wordpress had become. The WYSIWYG editor seems to vomit random HTML onto your page with no control over its syntax. The plugin environment is whole story unto itself. You'd better cross your fingers and hope the person who wrote the PHP did so in a secure and efficient manner. 

Having to constantly install security updates every other week just became one more annoyance to deal with. Backing up WordPress is itself a pain, that always left me wondering and guessing. The performance issues with WordPress are well documented. The bigger your site gets, the worse it suffers without taking the proper steps to optimize things. At the end of the day, WordPress just requires tons of overhead.

So when I learned about using Jekyll with Github pages from my coworker [@Joshtronic](3), it seemed like a great alternative. Jekyll is a Ruby based gem that compiles down into flat static files. Its simplicity makes backups easier and avoids all the common security concerns caused by running dynamic websites. 

Jekyll uses the Liquid templating language and basic HTML for it's templates. Or if you want to get fancy, you can do a HAML gem and SASS or dozen other available configurations. The possibilities are endless.

Posts are written in Markdown, which is fast and efficient. 

The fact that GitHub provides [free hosting for Jekyll blogs](http://pages.github.com/) is just icing on the cake. 

All of this is of course is in line with my plans for [Rebooting This Site](4)
