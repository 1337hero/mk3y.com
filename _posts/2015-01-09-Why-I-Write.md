Hi. I'm Mike.

I'm a husband, father, adventurer and wisdom seeker.

I have a fairly simple objective: I want to become the best possible version of myself.

Like you, I'm battling to become better and trying to put my own small dent in the universe all while trying to live life to the fullest.

I’m not smart enough to figure out everything myself, so I try to master the best of what other people have already figured out. Sounds simple, doesn’t it?

The best way to do this is to read a lot. And try new things, with a heavy dose of self experimentation. Along the way I write about what I’m learning and doing.

Why do this? Charlie Munger said it best:

"The best thing a human being can do is to help another human being know more."
