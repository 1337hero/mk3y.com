I’ll tell you why. It has to do with <strong>integrity</strong>, and you can’t have that when your pants are around your ankles while you are typing away with one hand. Not only that, if you are busy downloading and watching porn everyday, that is time you are losing from your entrepreneurial endeavors.</p> <p>**The simple truth is that we as men all struggle with porn at some point or another. **For some, it is just a brief encounter, and for others, it is an overwhelming struggle. Let’s be honest here. Everyone knows where to find it, and most of us are smart enough to keep it hidden. Heck, we all know the real reason why there is InPrivate browsing now. It is so we can look at porn without getting caught. It is the social norm now. Porn viewing is considered “cool”. Soft porn is everywhere, especially in advertising, even more so if you live in Europe.</p> <p>**So whats the big deal then? Porn doesn’t hurt anyone. Porn is Cool, right?<br /> **</p> <p><strong>WRONG!</strong></p> <p>**<!--more--></p> <p>**</p> <p>**Porn destroys lives.<br /> **</p> <h2 id="reality-check">**Reality Check</h2> <p>**</p> <p><strong>Now listen to me carefully here</strong>. Porn is like beer. One drink won’t destroy your life, but consuming large amounts over and over again on a regular basis will lead to all kinds of problems. Alcoholism and liver damage, for example; but even one to many drinks before a stint behind the wheel can destroy your and others lives, forever.**<br /> **</p> <p>Watching Porn doesn’t make you a man or make you cool. <strong>In fact, it makes you a pervert. <em>YES A PERVERT</em></strong>. It is a cheap substitute for the real thing. I’m sure porn makes you feel like a man. After all, the woman is there on the screen, ready, waiting, and you always satisfy her. <strong>But the truth is it is still fake</strong>. <strong>You’ve still got your junk your hand</strong>.</p> <p>Porn also devalues woman and how you see them.  Let enough porn in, and it will destroy many, if not all, of your relationships. Think about it: you are a married man, and you masturbate to pictures of thin, 20 yr-old woman everyday. It is not long before you are comparing your wife to those images. Your wife will become unattractive to you because she isn’t the ideal fantasy you have been feeding into your brain. You begin to devalue the woman most important in your life. If you are single, you will start seeing all women as objects to satisfy your every desire, and you will be unable to develop meaningful relationships. Think about it, do you think your wife or girlfriend wants to compete with what’s on the internet?</p> <p>Porn is a selfish addiction. It’s all about <strong>YOU</strong> getting <strong>YOURSELF</strong> off.</p> <h2 id="bad-for-business"><strong>Bad For Business</strong></h2> <p>Let’s think this one out. You’re a young entrepreneur. You want to build a successful lifestyle, but many entrepreneurs don’t give a second thought to their character or integrity. This is the reason why this country has such a problem with it’s leaders; most of our nation’s leaders are lacking character and integrity. For many, it is alright to have affairs, mistresses and to take deals behind closed doors. It’s private business they say. But let’s think this through, a man who thinks it is alright to take a vow to his wife, and then have an affair might think it’s ok to take money and bribes to vote a certain way. You’re private life does reflect how you will behave in public and how you will make decisions.</p> <p>Today, being a player or a pimp is idolized. There is even a show about guys who call themselves pickup artists who use cheap tricks to sleep with as many woman as they can. The porn industry is a 6 billion dollar industry, and that industry teaches us it is a perfectly natural, human behavior.</p> <p>I beg to differ. Viewing porn is secretly degrading your moral integrity. Remember when people use to tell you smoking was a gate-way drug? It doesn’t always lead to you doing LSD, and viewing porn won’t mean you’ll end up a child molester or serial rapist. But I will argue that it erodes something of your character every time you view it.</p> <p>To be completely honest, I wish I could put together a better article on porn because I have strong feelings on the subject. Many men are seriously addicted to it. I’m not sure when I started looking at it, around age 15-16 I believe, and for a long time it was almost a daily thing. I had several girlfriends break up with me over my porn viewing. It wasn’t until I stopped being so utterly seflish and gave my life to Christ that this addiction stopped. From time to time, I will admit, I’ve had it crop back up.  The temptation is always there, but you can get help.</p> <p>I know people and I am sure you have heard of people, getting fired over viewing pornography at work. I believe it challenges your integrity as a man.</p> <p>Oh, and to show you what PORN does to woman, view this video and visit the below sites.</p> <p>Listen to Shelley Lubben Tell the Hard Core Truth of What Woman are subjected to as a Porn Actress.
