No I’m NOT talking politics. We’ve bread a culture that believes things should be handed to them, that they no longer have to work hard for success, but that it should be handed to them.</p> <a href="/you-have-to-make-it-happen/" class="read-more">continue reading <svg class="shape-icon shape-arrow--broken"><use xlink:href="#arrowBroken"></use></svg></a> </li> </ul> <a href="/archive/">VISIT THE BLOG</a> </div> --> </div> <!-- footer start --> <footer class="wrap"> <section class="copyright">&copy; 2009–2016 <a href="mailto:mike@mk3y.com">MICHAEL KEY</a> &bull; ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.</section> <section class="poweredby">Made with <div class="heart"></div> using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com"> Jekyll</a></section> </footer> <!-- footer end --> </body> </html> </body> </html>
