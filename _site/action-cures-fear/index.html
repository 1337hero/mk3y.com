And guess what. Not taking action is what is stopping you from having everything you want. **</p> </blockquote> <p>If you want to succeed at anything chances are you’re going to have to <a href="http://www.mikekey.com/learning-to-get-outside-your-comfort-zone/">get outside of your comfort zone</a> and face some fears, take some risks and take some <strong>ACTION</strong>.</p> <p>How do you face that fear?</p> <p>With <strong>ACTION!</strong></p> <!--more--> <p>Stop thinking and trying to rationalize your fears and learn to take immediate action. If you’re afraid to talk to people, then start talking to people. Start by saying hello to random strangers where ever you go. The more action you take the more the fear will cease to be.</p> <p>When you take action you’ll begin to grow and your comfort zone will begin be stretched. If you really want to grow, get outside your comfort zone and stay there.</p> <p>Keep taking action. Whatever it is you want to achieve in life, it’s going to have to begin with you taking action. And if fear is the one thing holding you back, then the cure to that fear is <strong>ACTION</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Bonus Advice: Desire Follows Direction -</strong> You ever have one of those moments when you just don’t feel like doing it, but you know you need to do it? Well <a href="http://www.mikekey.com/just-do-it-anyways/"><strong>JUST DO IT ALREADY</strong></a>. Desire follows direction<strong>, act now – feelings later</strong>.** <strong>If you ever did something that you didn’t feel like doing and then later on you usually felt better for doing it, you applied this principle. See your desire and feelings will follow the direction the **ACTION</strong> you take.**<br /> **</p> </section> </article> </section> <div class="wrap"> <nav class="pagination"> <div> <a class="prev" href="/take-risks-for-greater-success/">&laquo; Take Risks for Greater Success</a> </div> <div style="text-align: right;"> <a class="next" href="/im-a-foursquare-cheater/">‘I’m a Foursquare Cheater' &raquo;</a> </div> </nav> </div> <nav role="navigation" class="wrap"> <div class="navigation"> <a href="/about/">BIO</a> <a href="https://instagram.com/boldadventure/" target="_blank">INSTAGRAM</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/mike_key" target="_blank">TWITTER</a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+MikeKey_adventurer" target="_blank">GOOGLE</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/mk3yllc/videos" target="_blank">YOUTUBE</a> </div> </nav> </div> <!-- footer start --> <footer class="wrap"> <section class="copyright">&copy; 2009–2016 <a href="mailto:mike@mk3y.com">MICHAEL KEY</a> &bull; ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.</section> <section class="poweredby">Made with <div class="heart"></div> using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com"> Jekyll</a></section> </footer> <!-- footer end --> </body> </html> </body> </html>
