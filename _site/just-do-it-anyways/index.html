What do you want to do that you are afraid to do because you are too busy worrying about what others might think?</p> <p>Listen to me carefully. <strong>It does not matter what other people think of your idea.</strong> If you have something you want to do, some idea or some perspective, just do it. Share it with the world. Don’t worry about what others will think or say. You will be better off for having done it, then not.</p> <p>I made a post about my perspective on Porn and I’m pretty sure that 90% of people don’t agree with me on it. So what? I had something I’ve been wanting to share for awhile and I did it. And I feel better for sharing it. Rather than just being quiet about it. It doesn’t matter if I failed to convince anyone to see my perspective. What matters is that I did it.</p> <p>When I quit my job a lot of my family members said I was nuts. It was the end of the world. “Oh no what are you going to do now” they said. But it didn’t matter, I had a dream and I wanted to start my own business, I wanted to get free from the template lifestyle and to live life my way on my terms. So I just went out and did it.</p> <p>That’s what you have to do. Even if it’s rude to others, ignore them and pursue it.</p> <p>So my question stands.
