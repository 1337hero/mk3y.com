						<p>Why in the heck would I talk about PORN on a website about lifestyle design and entrepreneurship you might ask. I’ll tell you why. It has to do with <strong>integrity</strong>, and you can’t have that when your pants are around your ankles while you are typing away with one hand. Not only that, if you are busy downloading and watching porn everyday, that is time you are losing from your entrepreneurial endeavors.</p>

<p>**The simple truth is that we as men all struggle with porn at some point or another. **For some, it is just a brief encounter, and for others, it is an overwhelming struggle. Let’s be honest here. Everyone knows where to find it, and most of us are smart enough to keep it hidden. Heck, we all know the real reason why there is InPrivate browsing now. It is so we can look at porn without getting caught. It is the social norm now. Porn viewing is considered “cool”. Soft porn is everywhere, especially in advertising, even more so if you live in Europe.</p>

<p>**So whats the big deal then? Porn doesn’t hurt anyone. Porn is Cool, right?<br />
**</p>

<p><strong>WRONG!</strong></p>

						<p><strong><a href="#update">Updated 11/23/2011</a></strong></p>

<p>Do you hate pumping gas? The routine feels like such a hassel to me. I have to fight to find a free pump most times, and if I do find a free pummp, then I’ve got to make sure I pull up to it with the tank on the right side. You’ve gotta get out of your car, walk around, go thru all those annoying menu’s on the pump. Or worse yet, go inside and prepay. Ugh, yuck.</p>

<p>So you’re probably wondering what pumping gas has to do with Multi-level Marketing. Well there I was, minding my business one fateful afternoon when young man on the other side of my pump decided to pitch his MLM to me.</p>

<p>“Wow, nice Audi, what kind of gas mileage does that thing get?”</p>

<p>“I manage to get about 21-22 city and 27 highway” I replied.</p>

<p>He replied unusually enthusiastic with an “AWESOME MAN!”</p>

<p>“Hey, can I ask what you do?”</p>

<p>Ahh… my favorite question! So I responded; “I hike, camp, rock climb, go kayaking, build websites, read, stuff like that.”</p>

<p>The puzzled expression on his face was a dead give away I had just given him a curve ball to his usual elevator pitch.</p>

<p>Pausing for a brief moment, he replied; “Oh wow, good deal man. I’m actually working with a business team out of Raleigh, North Carolina, helping folks develop web based businesses. We’re actually looking for some sharp folks like yourself who are looking to earn some extra income. Do you keep your options open?”</p>

<p>Carefully thinking over my reply, I realized this was a ploy to get me to come see some MLM plan. More than likely he was your typical IBO with Amway.</p>

<p>“Do I keep my options open? Well who doesn’t keep their options open! Especially if you believe that we live in the land of opportunity. But I’ve learned to carefully evaluate those opportunities and to recognize dead end opportunities without wasting my time. And I’m afraid I’m all to familiar with our pitch. So, to answer your question, I’m not open to your offer at this time.”</p>

<p>From the look he gave me, I knew I had just sunk his battleship.</p>

<p>Has this happened to you? Have you been approached by some young adult, who appears well dressed and genuinely polite?<br />

						<p>One of the things I have learned while rock climbing is that what often seems impossible for us to accomplish is more in our own mind than it is in reality.</p>

<p>I remember my first real outdoor rock climbing experience at the Delaware Water Gap. On that very first trip, it had rained earlier in the day and the rock face was still wet and even muddy in some places. This was a completely new experience and well outside my comfort zone. I am actually a bit scared of heights.</p>

<p>I started off pretty easy and began to get excited as I climbed. I must have climbed about 50 feet before I came to a section that seemed impassable. I was holding onto this one spot with everything I had. The rock was wet, and it felt like I could fail at any moment. I thought there was no physical way I could achieve the next move to continue climbing. It required me to lift my left leg up while extending out and then standing up on a ledge to my left that was at chest height. All I had to do was get my foot up on that hold, and then reach for the next hold above it. But to do this required letting go of the rock face. Right now, I was comfortable and safe., but this move would put me in a vulnerable position. If I didn’t do it right, I would miss and fall, which was still terrifying even though I was hooked into a rope and harness.

				<span>

						<p>If you are ready to start getting intentional about how you are going to live your life and actually truly live a kickass life, here is how you can do it. In 6 simple steps.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>BECOME PASSIONATE</strong><br />
If you are really going to change your lifestyle and start LIVING, then you are going to have to become passionate. No more straddling the fence there, Buster. It is time to commit to your dream, to that vision of how you want to live.When I became passionate and put real emotion behind my dreams, I went from that guy who was always going to do something, to the guy who HAD DONE SOMETHING.&lt;/p&gt; 
I’m sure you have heard people say that you need to find what you are passionate about and then pursue it. That’s great for finding a way to make an income, but if you don’t have passion for very much, you won’t achieve anything beyond that. You need to become passionate about the vision of the life you want. Do you want a new red sports car? Then get passionate about it.&lt;/li&gt; 
    <ul>
      <li><strong>START READING</strong><br />
The lazy man of mediocrity sits in front of his TV and absorbs. There is a reason it is called the “Boob Tube”. If you want to grow and live a successful lifestyle, it is time to start reading and educating yourself. I never really liked to read, but my mentor always told me it doesn’t matter if you like to read or not, you just need to do it. Commit to read at least 30 minutes a day.But what to read? Check out my book list here for starters. Also, start seeking out websites and blogs on what you’re trying to achieve.  Not only do I read books on entrepreneurship, personal development, finances and investing, but I also read blogs on these subjects.&lt;/p&gt; 
But that’s not all, I read travel blogs and magazines too, because that goes back to step 1 and fuels my passion for how I want to live my life and what I want to do.&lt;/li&gt; 
        <ul>
          <li><strong>STOP COMPLAINING</strong><br />
Seriously, stop complaining about your boss. Stop complaining about your spouse. Stop complaining about the government and everything else you whine about. Do you know who complains? <strong>LOSERS COMPLAIN</strong>. If you make up your mind to stop complaining and only notice the positive around you, you’ll notice a huge improvement in your attitude and in the circumstances of your life.</li>
          <li>**START DOING<br />
**Doers get things done. Don’t wait for other people. Get out there and take action<img src="http://www.mikekey.com/luck-is-bullcrap/" alt=" Stop waiting for lady luck" title="Lady Luck is BULLCRAP" /> and make it happen yourself. It is that simple. If you want to change your life, then you are going to have to start taking action. That’s how I did it, and that’s what you need to do.Idleness will lead to nothing.</li>
          <li><strong>GET OUTSIDE YOUR COMFORT ZONE</strong><br />
If you are comfortable where you are at you will be stagnate. The only thing in nature that is stagnate is a swamp. Everything else is either growing or dying. So what are you doing? If you want to grow, you will have to get outside of your comfort zone.I learned this while rock climbing this summer, hanging onto the side of a cliff a thousand feet up, going well outside my comfort zone. Every time that my mind wanted to give up, I’d push myself and find that I was capable of more than my mind wanted to believe.  Every time that I retreated and failed to push myself, giving up, I have regretted.For example, if you are afraid of being around a large crowd of people, then you NEED to hang around a large crowd of people until you are comfortable. You grow the most when you are outside your comfort zone.</li>
          <li><strong>START LIVING</strong><br />
Quit your job if you have to. You only get one life. Why waste your life? You need to start living! Start doing some of the things you dream of doing. You don’t have to do all of them at once, and maybe some of them require you to be more well off. Start small and work your way up towards your goals.Trust me, you aren’t living while working in a cubical 60 hours a week hoping for the weekend. That is not what we were created to do. That is not a life.&lt;/ol&gt; 
So that’s it. If you want to live an awesome life start there. I’ll share more insights as time goes on.</li>
        </ul>

						<p>Have you ever heard someone complain that he/she just isn’t lucky enough? Usually the conversation goes like this “Oh, I am just not lucky enough; I never win at anything.” People will chalk up all their failures in life to being unlucky. Many of these same people live their lives just hoping to get lucky.  These are the folks who might dream of success but don’t do anything about it because they are waiting for that “big break” or the “right moment”, that point in time when they will get lucky.</p>

<p>The luck mindset can be crippling to your potential as a human being.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>Luck is complete bullcrap.</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong> It does not exist.<br /> </strong>
</p>

<p>There is no such thing as good or bad luck. PERIOD! People aren’t born lucky or unlucky. What there is, however, is circumstance. Circumstances dictate what will and will not happen. As completely awesome as it would be, you are not going to get lucky and magically lose 10lbs overnight; and <strong>you most certainly will not get lucky and discover yourself a millionaire just because.</strong></p>

<p>People aren’t born lucky; they have to make things happen. **Stop waiting for lady luck to appear and take control of your own life. **</p>

<p><strong>Listen you are going to fail more often than succeed</strong>. It doesn’t boil down to luck. It’s just life.** <strong>You have to stop saying “I’m unlucky”. Stop the self doubt and start believing and doing.</strong><br />

						<p>If you are living pay check to paycheck and hoping to one day be rich and debt free, consider these 5 Warning Signs that You Will Stay Poor.</p>

<p>If these <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>WARNING SIGNS</strong></span> apply to you or a loved one, fear not. While this information may be hard to swallow at first, there is hope. You can get help and start making immediate changes to your lifestyle that will result in you not remaining poor.</p>

<p><strong>Please be sure to share this important information with everyone you know!</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h3 id="you-keep-spending-more-than-you-earn">You keep spending more than you earn.</h3>

    <p>This one is a no brainier. <strong>Every time you spend more money than you have earned, you are in debt.</strong> If this is how you live, making $1.25 and spending a $1.50, you’ll always remain poor.&lt;/li&gt; 
*   ### Your wheels cost more than your car.</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-374" title="Bling Bling" src="http://www.mikekey.com/romans/wp-content/assets/2009/12/Picture-198-150x150.jpg" alt="Bling Bling" width="195" height="195" /&gt;You invested $4,000 dollars on a car worth $800 bucks. **When your financial priorities are out of balance it is guaranteed that you will not be acquiring wealth anytime soon.**
    
Other examples include: No money to fix your car, but you  bought a new plasma television. You can&amp;#8217;t pay child support, but you bought an &amp;#8217;09 Corvette Z06. The power company turned off your lights because you didn&amp;#8217;t pay your bill, but you&amp;#8217;re wearing 80 dollar jeans so your butt will look good when you go out to the club.&lt;/li&gt; 
*   ### You believe there is a Conspiracy to Keep You Poor and Stupid, Aka Blame &amp;#8220;The Man&amp;#8221;
        
    **It&amp;#8217;s up to you to educate yourself about finances and to do something about it.** ***Stop blaming someone else for your problems. **Stop blaming the government officials you elected. Stop blaming corporations. Stop blaming bad luck. Stop blaming the man in the sky. Stop blaming the credit card companies and your bank.  
    *
        
    * *
        
    It&amp;#8217;s your own fault for getting yourself into debt.* *So long as you think that everyone else is out to keep you poor and dumb, you will remain poor.*  
    *&lt;/li&gt; 
    *   ### You notice the “cost per month” price on items.
            
        **It should be obvious that if you can&amp;#8217;t pay for it in cash, you can&amp;#8217;t afford it.** If the only thing that matters when you go to buy something is what kind of payments you can make, then chances are you are going to remain poor.
            
        Consider this: you have just been promoted to manager at Kinko&amp;#8217;s  and you are looking at a brand new BMW. The car salesmen tells you that you can drive this new car home today for only  $549 a month for  72 months. That&amp;#8217;s a sweet deal! Heck the car is only 32K, and you make that in a year! Right?
            
        Here is why you are poor. That car will actually cost you in the long run a total of $39,562 at 7% APR. **That sweet deal actually cost you an additional ****$4,000. **&lt;/li&gt; 
        *   ### You Keep spending money on Weed, Cigarettes, Beer or PORN.
                
            **&lt;img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-317" title="Do you want to look like this guy?" src="http://www.mikekey.com/romans/wp-content/assets/2009/12/3310615095_e0fa3b4571_o.jpg" alt="Do you want to look like this guy?" width="195" height="210" /&gt;Nothing is more expensive than addictive habits. **Not only are they unhealthy, but they are keeping you in the poor house.
                
            A pack of cigarettes cost almost $5 on average—with some states tacking on additional taxes that raise the price. In New York City, for example, local taxes have pushed the cost of a pack to more than $10 in most stores. You are literally smoking your money every time you light one up.
                
            Making a habit out of getting high or drunk just to have fun will end up hurting your wallet in the long run. You don&amp;#8217;t need to be hammered or stoned to enjoy life or to relax. If you have a real job (besides flipping burgers) you want to risk your income by doing drugs. Random drug screenings anyone?
                
            All to often, finance gurus fail to mention that **PORN**, a highly addictive and widely popular habit, is also a huge waste of your money.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; 
            If you or anyone you know is suffering from these warning signs be sure to immediately read my &amp;#8220;[4 Ways to be Richer][1]&amp;#8220;

  <strong>Proverbs 29:18 &#8220;Where there is no vision, the people perish&#8221;</strong>
</p>

<p>This is not just an ancient proverb stuffed into an old book, it is a reality of life. A well thought out vision defines where you want to go and what you want to achieve. It is more than just setting some goals and writing them down. It is a clear mental picture of how you will live, how you will accomplish those goals, and what life will be like when you get there.</p>

<p>Think of Martin Luther King, casting his vision of a day when whites and blacks would sit down at the table of humanity together, equal. His passion, his drive were complete evidence of his clarity of vision. His clarity of vision was shared before thousands, and it moved those masses to change this nation for the better.</p>

						<p>I am in the mindset that now is the best time to start a business, even with our economy in the dumps. If you are thinking about starting a business but are concerned with the economy, here are my 5 reasons why now is the time to launch your business.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h3 id="reason-1">Reason 1:</h3>

    <p>**Most of the competition is going out of business or is already out of business. **A lot of companies can’t survive a downturn for a number of reasons. In some cases it is a lack of funding, poor management or simply, they suck.&lt;/li&gt; 
*   ### Reason 2:</p>

    <pre><code>** Consumers are choosier.** In a time of plenty, people maybe less likely to bother looking around for better deals. In an economic downturn shoppers are forced to think hard about their choices. This is the other reason why the above statement is true about your competition.&lt;/li&gt; 
*   ### Reason 3:
        
    **There is less competition for laborers** right now so you can get good help for a reasonable cost. Thanks to the internet, you can even outsource to laborers overseas.&lt;/li&gt; 
    *   ### Reason 4:
            
        Technology has drastically **reduced the cost of running a business.** I could spend all day listing the online resources available &amp;#8211; free in most cases &amp;#8211; that could cut overhead costs. Thanks to the internet again, you can do business with the entire world.&lt;/li&gt; 
        *   ### Reason 5:
                
            ** Most people already think now is a bad time to go into business**. It&amp;#8217;s like the stock market. People always jump on board right before it crashes and end up losing all their money. You have to ride it up from the bottom and get out when the going is good.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; 
            These are just a couple of the reasons I&amp;#8217;m starting a new business venture, MK3Y. If you have some good reasons why you think now is a great time to start a business, go ahead and share in the comments below.

						<p>In our busy lives we often do not pay much attention to the little daily decisions we make. Few even pay attention to what it is they are aiming at in life. However, for those of you who have set goals and targets, I ask this question: are you aiming at the right thing?</p>

<p>In the 2004 Olympics, a man named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Emmons">Matthew Emmons</a> was on track for the Gold medal in the 50 meter three position rifle final. He was so far ahead in points that all he had to do was get his bullet anywhere inside the inner ring of the target and the gold medal was his.</p>

<p>As he aimed for his final shot, he prepared himself mentally, paused his breathing, took aim and then fired.
