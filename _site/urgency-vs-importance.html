Regret that I’m not getting things done.</p> <p>Not getting things done has been a bit of a problem in 2014.</p> <p>Over the holiday we took the Airstream up to Ocala and I set my mind to working on a few projects.</p> <p>But the reality is, I needed to unwind and refresh myself more than anything. The stress of the past year had soured my mood and left my spirit more broken than I realized.</p> <p>Then one evening while we were in Ocala, I came across a post by Oliver Emberton on ‘How To Master Your Time’</p> <p>Oliver made the point that:</p> <p>“The secret to mastering your time is to systematically focus on importance and suppress urgency. Humans are pre-wired to focus on things which demand an immediate response, like alerts on their phones – and to postpone things which are most important, like going to the gym. You need to reverse that, which goes against your brain and most of human society.”</p> <p>Then it hit me, this is a source of big stress at my current job. But not even at work, I have a tendency to create little projects for myself that I treat as urgent.</p> <p>But what’s important to me is that we meet our goal this year. That our family hits the road for fulltime travel.</p> <p>Everything else that is demanding my attention is just a distraction.</p> </section> </article> </section> <div class="wrap"> <nav class="pagination"> <div> <a class="prev" href="/a-year-of-action">&laquo; A Year of Action</a> </div> <div style="text-align: right;"> <a class="next" href="/be-a-content-curator">Be a Content Curator &raquo;</a> </div> </nav> </div> <nav role="navigation" class="wrap"> <div class="navigation"> <a href="/about/">BIO</a> <a href="https://instagram.com/boldadventure/" target="_blank">INSTAGRAM</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/mike_key" target="_blank">TWITTER</a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+MikeKey_adventurer" target="_blank">GOOGLE</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/mk3yllc/videos" target="_blank">YOUTUBE</a> </div> </nav> </div> <!-- footer start --> <footer class="wrap"> <section class="copyright">&copy; 2009–2016 <a href="mailto:mike@mk3y.com">MICHAEL KEY</a> &bull; ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.</section> <section class="poweredby">Made with <div class="heart"></div> using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com"> Jekyll</a></section> </footer> <!-- footer end --> </body> </html> </body> </html>
