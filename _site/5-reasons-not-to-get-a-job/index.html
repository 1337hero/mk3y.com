            <p>There is a simple reason not get a job: It’s income for dummies. I don’t know who said that quote first, but I know I’ve heard it dozens of times. Maybe you have too, but the truth is, it’s a hard reality for some to face.</p>

<p>Society has been lying to you since the beginning of the last century. Prior to the 1900’s and the industrial revolution 92% of all Americans were self-employed in some fashion. The problem today is our horrible education system. You see, we don’t teach people about our own system of economics in schools any more. Instead, we teach children to get a JOB.</p>

<p>The formula for success you’re told is this: study hard + getting good grades + going to college + getting a good job = SUCCESS! Well, how is that working out for you these days?</p>

<p>It’s time for a reality check. Here are my five favorite reasons why NOT to get a job.<!--more--></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h3 id="placing-your-financial-security-in-the-hands-of-someone-else"><strong>Placing your Financial Security in the hands of someone else</strong></h3>

    <p>Sure, getting a job and trading your time for dollars may seem like a good idea. (Our military members trade years for dollars). There is only one problem with this idea, you put someone else in control of your life.</p>

    <p>Seriously, you are letting someone else decide how much you are worth, when you are allowed to make money, and how much of it you are allowed to make. Rich people make money 24/7, often using ways to get other people, like YOU, to make money for them.&lt;/li&gt; 
*   ### <strong>It’s Risky</strong></p>

    <pre><code>**You are always ONE accident away from losing your income!**
    
This is a big one. Slip and break your back and you won&amp;#8217;t be working. If you work manual labor, the chances of you getting hurt on the job and losing your income go way up. Once you stop being valuable to your company, there goes your paycheck. You get paid based on your ability to produce, and what happens when you can&amp;#8217;t produce?
    
Here is a great quote from [Steve Pavlina][1] on the subject:
    
&gt; &amp;#8220;Does putting yourself in a position where someone else can turn off all your income just by saying two words (”You’re fired”) sound like a safe and secure situation to you? Does having only one income stream honestly sound more secure than having 10?
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;#8220;The idea that a job is the most secure way to generate income is just silly. You can’t have security if you don’t have control, and employees have the least control of anyone. If you’re an employee, then your real job title should be professional gambler.&amp;#8221;
</code></pre>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3 id="you-have-no-freedom"><strong>You Have No Freedom</strong></h3>

        <p>Depending on the kind of job you have, you will be told: what to wear, when to show up, when you are allowed to go on break, when you can go home, how many days you are allowed to be sick, how many days you are allowed for vacation, how much you will be paid, when you will be paid, etc. See my point yet? <strong>No freedom.</strong> You are exchanging your freedom for dollars. If you have to ask to use the restroom, then you have real problems. I hope you place a high value on your freedom and self respect.&lt;/li&gt; 
*   ### <strong>You ARE Replaceable, Period</strong></p>

        <pre><code>Employees are the most expensive asset for any company to maintain. If you don&amp;#8217;t believe that, just look at what happened to General Motors. In the digital age and developing nations galore, it is a lot easier for your employer to simply replace you with cheaper workers or even with younger workers fresh out of college, for half your salary.&lt;/li&gt; 
*   ### **It&amp;#8217;s Stupid**
            
    Seriously it is **STUPID**. I don&amp;#8217;t want to sound like a jerk here, but you are actually allowing yourself to be on the bottom of the food chain. If you get paid a salary, you are actually working more and getting paid less. Plus, EMPLOYEES pay the most taxes. This nation is setup to support business, not workers. That is why more of your tax money is taken out of your check each and every week. Part of the money you earn is gone by the time it gets to you. Add in your deductions that you have as an employee and you have lost even more income. It is stupid not to be self employed. Heck, you should at least consider getting a side hustle going just for the tax benefits. Wouldn&amp;#8217;t you like to keep the money you make?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; 
    Do you want to be caught up in the rat race for the rest of your life? Just so you can do what? Retire at age 72 and collect social security?
            
    At this point you may be angry with me or wondering what to do about your job. It&amp;#8217;s okay. Many entrepreneurs, lifestyle designers, investors and the like started off on the traditional income path before moving on to better things. Ask yourself this, do you want the freedom to set your hours, work when you want to work, travel when you want to travel, and live as you want to live?
            
    If so, then the first thing you need to do is reprogram your brain. I have a list of reading materials here that will greatly help get you into the right frame of mind.
