During that time this site has been without comments. My intent moving forward was to move some of those conversations Disqus.</p> <p>After not much thought, I’ve decided against it completely.</p> <p>I plan on just doing some social sharing options at the bottom of each post. Boring, I know.</p> <p>The upside to this is ‘freed up time’</p> <p>I have saved myself a ton of time as I am no longer answering tons of comments every single day, managing spam, and then other assorted pings.</p> <p>If anyone would respond to one of my blog posts with their own post I would get a ping and then I would obsess over what they had said. I would draft epic responses and then sometimes immediately regret that I did.</p> <p>I have been lightly and heavily criticized for not having comments enabled on my blog and how I am less “social” and “engaging” and even “relevant” to the times.</p> <p>Whateverz!</p> <p>Done with spam, and done with unnecessary blog clutter.</p> <p>Cheers to freedom and more headroom to spend time on shit that matters.</p> </section> </article> </section> <div class="wrap"> <nav class="pagination"> <div> <a class="prev" href="/why-I-am-writing">&laquo; Why I am Writing</a> </div> <div style="text-align: right;"> <a class="next" href="/desire-follows-direction">Desire Follows Direction &raquo;</a> </div> </nav> </div> <nav role="navigation" class="wrap"> <div class="navigation"> <a href="/about/">BIO</a> <a href="https://instagram.com/boldadventure/" target="_blank">INSTAGRAM</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/mike_key" target="_blank">TWITTER</a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+MikeKey_adventurer" target="_blank">GOOGLE</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/mk3yllc/videos" target="_blank">YOUTUBE</a> </div> </nav> </div> <!-- footer start --> <footer class="wrap"> <section class="copyright">&copy; 2009–2016 <a href="mailto:mike@mk3y.com">MICHAEL KEY</a> &bull; ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.</section> <section class="poweredby">Made with <div class="heart"></div> using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com"> Jekyll</a></section> </footer> <!-- footer end --> </body> </html> </body> </html>
