Back in 2006 I discovered the then relatively new WordPress version 2 and decided to start blogging. I immediately fell in love with it and began learning CSS and PHP to tweak the theme. But I wasn’t a true blogger at the time. I was more of a tinkerer. Always fiddling with my website in my spare time.</p> <p>That would change in Dec of 2009, when I decided to take my freelance business full-time. I set a goal for self promotion, and began blogging about entrepreneurship, self improvement and lifestyle design after. Out of the gate I turned out a number of articles, but as my business took off my blog and personal website flatlined.</p> <hr /> <p>Unfortunately, I haven’t blogged as much in the recent past; my waking hours spent worrying about business and life issues than crafting new content. Things I would have blogged about in the past are now published as <a href="3">tweets</a>. Adventures to talk about have become images shared on my <a href="4">Instagram</a> account.</p> <!--more--> <p>Today, I find myself right back where I was in 2009. 2015 is going to be a big year of change for my family. We’re launching ourselves on an exciting adventure and taking some huge personal risks.</p> <p>As part of my upcoming endeavors I need to have an established online brand again. As a professional front end developer, a lack of website, or for that matter, a broken website speaks volumes.</p> <p>Recently I find myself wanting to share more of my thoughts openly and freely. When I do have the time, I thoroughly enjoy writing long-form articles and have been collecting my thoughts in a wonderful app called DayOne for the past year.</p> <p>For this these reasons, I’ve decided its time to reboot this site and get back to writing.</p> <p>I have a few goals in mind for this project, which I hope to have completed and running Jan 1st, 2015.</p> <h2 id="project-goals">Project Goals</h2> <ul> <li>~~Roll ubuntu 14.04 server with LEMP~~</li> <li>~~Migrate from WordPress to Jeykll~~</li> <li>~~Move blog comments to Disqus~~</li> <li>~~Deploy repo of site on Github~~</li> <li>~~Deploy Cloudflare CDN~~</li> <li>~~301 Redirect MikeKey.com to mk3y.com~~</li> <li>Redesign Website for 2015</li> <li>Rewrite About Page</li> <li>Set regular blogging goals (2 posts per month)</li> <li>Learn new skills</li> </ul> <p><a href="https://github.com/devbymike/mk3y.com">1</a> <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">2</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/mike_key">3</a> <a href="http://instagram.com/boldadventure">4</a></p> </section> </article> </section> <div class="wrap"> <nav class="pagination"> <div> <a class="prev" href="/dream-big-act-big/">&laquo; Dream Big, Act Big</a> </div> <div style="text-align: right;"> <a class="next" href="/jekyll-github-pages">Jekyll + Github Pages > WordPress &raquo;</a> </div> </nav> </div> <nav role="navigation" class="wrap"> <div class="navigation"> <a href="/about/">BIO</a> <a href="https://instagram.com/boldadventure/" target="_blank">INSTAGRAM</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/mike_key" target="_blank">TWITTER</a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+MikeKey_adventurer" target="_blank">GOOGLE</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/mk3yllc/videos" target="_blank">YOUTUBE</a> </div> </nav> </div> <!-- footer start --> <footer class="wrap"> <section class="copyright">&copy; 2009–2016 <a href="mailto:mike@mk3y.com">MICHAEL KEY</a> &bull; ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.</section> <section class="poweredby">Made with <div class="heart"></div> using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com"> Jekyll</a></section> </footer> <!-- footer end --> </body> </html> </body> </html>
