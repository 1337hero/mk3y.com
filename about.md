##Who
My name is **Mike Key** and I created this site. If you spend enough time around here, youâ€™ll notice that I have a sincere passion for life, learning, self improvement and entrepreneurship. [JorDanee](http://jk3y.com) and I have been married 5 years and we have a 12mo old daughter with a second on the way in April.

I make a living banging out code as a front end developer for [Wihp](http://wihphotels.com). 

##WordPress

In 2009 I started a freelance business, MK3Y was born. I itched out a living for myself helping clients with WordPress websites, including running the local WordPress meetup in my hometown of Hampton Roads.

Since that time I have built and launched nearly two dozen WordPress sites. 

Only recently have I stopped using WordPress for my personal projects, only to further develop and sharpen my skillset.
