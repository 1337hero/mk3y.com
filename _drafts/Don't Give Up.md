Life is too short to be living someone else's dream or idea of success.

I'm not sure if it's a result of turning past 30, but it seems as though I think more and more about death, and loss of life. And more about the things that are really important to me, such as my family.

Maybe it's a result of having a daughter with a second on the way, that has resulted in a shift in priorities.

I feel like I wasted my twenties, chasing girls, trying to impress friends and be 'successful'. All while abandoning the passions and hobbies of my youth.
