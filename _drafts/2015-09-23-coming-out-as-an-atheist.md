#Coming out as an Atheist

It was surprising to me, that after disclosing to people that I am an Atheist, no one asked me why.

Not amongst friends, family or acquaintances. This came as a bit of a shock, since for the past 12 years I've been a devout Christian.

So how is it that not even one person asked how this great change had taken place in my life?

I came to realize that this was because most people had already made up their own conclusions. And for the most part, this conclusion was that I had been "Turned Off" by the church.

The reasoning, there had been to many negative experiences. And based on that I had rejected the church and god all together.

This is completely untrue.  What surprised me more; no matter how much I try to explain that my memories of church are actually fond ones, people seem to hold onto the same explanation.

The next surprise is from other Christians who never knew me. The common line of reasoning there is that I was never actually a true Christian. That I was never truly saved. For if I was, I would have never made the decision to leave God.

This too is untrue.

I had a personal relationship with Christ, and was confidently assured of my salvation. I attended church regularly, read my bible daily, studied theology, prayed daily and have fond memories of  worship.

My leaving the faith is based on rational and logical judgements based on the discovery of consistent indication and coherent evidence.

The whole point of this post is share my own personal story and the reasons why I came to these conclusions.

## My Story

I did not grow up in a religious home. I was raised by a single mother who did the best she could. We weren't catholics, baptists or anything really. But like many in America we identified as such because

1. we were not Jewish

2. we celebrated Christmas and Easter

3. traditions; the faith of our ancestors

For the most part, my upbringing was secular. And I was exposed to a lot of science fiction television. Science and astronomy was one of my favorite subjects in middle school. I built model rockets, and even painted my room black so I could line the walls with glow in the dark stickers. I was fascinated by the way the world worked. And after school I would play with lego's for hours. To say I was a kid with an active imagination would be an understatement.

But this isn't where my religious conversion happened. It was gradual.

I wasn't a popular kid by any means. I wasn't athletic. And I was bullied in school. I had a hard time adjusting to high school and ended up dropping out. I finished up my GED and started working and moved out when I was 18. (More like kicked out)

For the most part, I was living a secular life. Fast forward a few years and plenty of mistakes. I was working a good solid job as a contractor with the Navy/USMC when I lost said job.

My ego proceeded to implode over the following months. A coworker, who will remain unnamed had already been somewhat of an influence on me.

He had given me a book called Maximized Manhood and Wild At Heart that changed my perspectives on a lot. And spoke to something within my heart I didn't know was there. A longing.

When I lost my job, he invited me to his church, the first time I had ever gone to a church in my young adult life. And that Sunday, it felt as though the pastor of this church was speaking just to me.

It was a talk about manhood. It resonated with my heart. As an adult now, I realize that the thing missing from my life was a father figure. Add to that a lack of real male friendships in early adulthood made me more susceptible to the embrace of a church community.

This was my introduction to &#39;mainstream&#39; christianity.

I became deeply religious and more involved in the church. I became convinced that my calling was to mens ministry. 

Christianity was a daily part of my life and my identity throughout my twenties. Along with it came all the ideas, beliefs and cognitive biases one would label "right wing" or "conservative".

I had a community, I felt a sense or purpose and I was passionate about my beliefs. I read my bible daily, prayed and even studied theology, apologetics and my favorite creation (pseudo)science.

I spent 6 years in my first church and was married by one of our pastors. That church Faith Alive collapsed in 2009 with the revelation that the pastor had an affair. This was a blow. This was a man I looked up to, a man I respected. A man I prayed with every Sunday in the men&#39;s prayer meeting. My wife and I would remain without a church home for the next year and half.

In August 2011 we moved to Florida, and joined my brother in-laws church where he was the pastor. Let's just say our beliefs didn't line up and we had a falling out. And ended up leaving his church too.

At that time I had another friend going through some similar things. He had moved from the very common theology of the "prosperity gospel" into a more traditional "reformed" version of christianity. And also informed me of some of the problems and sources of the heavy new age influences on mainstream christianity. 

I began to study and take my theology more seriously, and found myself embracing a more reformed approach to Christianity. I studied systematic theology and eventually found a church that was reformed and part of the Acts 29 network that we attended briefly for about a year.

That was until the realization that Life Bridge Church is a cult.  I won&#39;t go into great detail (in this post) other than my wife and I along with several other friends in attendance at the time were subject to humiliation, insults, harassment and flat out spiritual abuse.

Naturally we left that church. And we moved from Saint Petersburg to Clearwater.

This left us both hurting, deeply and spiritually.

I didn't realize it but I was angry and bitter for about a year after the incident. I spent a great deal of time praying and working it out with god.

But one of the things from these two experiences in Florida that rose to the surface was:

**Why do I believe what I believe?**

and

**How do I know what I believe is correct?**

Our situation is this: most of the people in this world believe that the Creator of the universe has written a book. We have the misfortune of having many such books on hand, each making an exclusive claim about its infallibility. 

With so many denominations, and so many interruptions of the bible. With each denomination convinced they've got the revelation and their interruption is the right way. 

How do I know what is right?

And to quote Sam Harris:

> It's a very strange sort of loving God who would make salvation depend on believing in him on bad evidence. Ok, it's, it's, I mean, if you lived 2,000 years ago, there was evidence galore, I mean, he was just performing miracles. But apparently, he got tired of being so helpful. And so now, we all inherit this very heavy burden of the doctrine's implausibility. And, and, and, and the effort to square it with what we now know about the cosmos and what we know about the all-too-human origins of Scripture becomes more and more difficult.

This lead me to look at the picture of church history and theology as a whole. This brought to light a lot of revelations.

The biggest change in thought was the simple realization that faith, was the answer to "Why am I believing this".

Faith is the thing that causes one to abandon all reason and logic. The more I tried to look at this logically, the more and more it kept leading me to the same conclusion. 

This is the problem we are left with. The burden of proof.

Follow the history, who was Jesus, did he even exist? The reality becomes simply more and more clear. Pure, blind faith, contrary to the evidence is required to keep believing. Insert your feelings and you can rationalize it all day.

For this was all a problem.

And as an adult, my love for knowledge and science began to weigh on me under these revelations.

I began to seek out others on subjects of logic and reason, history and sciences.

However my two favorite subjects, history and science presented me with so much overwhelming evidence  that the idea of a god is practically absurd. Especially any god that could be contained within a book.

A dread set in for a while. But it was slowly replaced with a calm and a new sense of joy and wonder in the world. A new appreciation for just how truly precious life is.

The fact for me is, I live now, here in the present. Not some futuretense. My mistakes are my own to learn from.
