For the last four months I've been free of the horrible time sucking waste of mediocrity that is Facesuck. And there is no looking back, and no regrets. My life is extensively better without that mass distraction and time sink that is Facebook.

Now, this might come as a shock to many of you who might find it odd that I would do such a thing but I can assure you that it wasn’t an easy decision and not one that was done in haste. I had been thinking about this for quite some time and some conversations with my friends yesterday helped move the needle into the “execution” part of my plan.

I hadn’t planned on wiping my Facebook profile yesterday but that’s what organically happened. I even managed to capture a video (which didn’t record my audio, so I added a voice-over after) which is embedded in this post and which shares a few of my thoughts about this endeavor.

I first joined Facebook in October of 2003 – a girlfriend at the time signed me up and told me that I “had” to be on this site because that’s what everyone was doing. She went ahead and created an account (got my email address wrong) and so I wasn’t actually able to use it until nearly a year later when I created a new one with the right email address.

Since then Facebook has changed dramatically, many times over. To be honest, the subsequent iterations of designs and features made it less attractive as it grew and expanded, and as it especially began to show it’s foundational goals of profiting as a business. This isn’t a bad thing and there was nothing wrong with FB attempting to make a buck (or two… or a billion) but I’m not sure it was done with taste or with complete respect for its users.

In fact, I know it hasn’t been in the slightest. Add a layer of despotic commercial control and awkward privacy policies and terms of service and you’ve got nothing but embarrassment. Get out while you still can.

But outside of my philosophical perspective, fast-forward to 2012 and I was still using it but it had lost it luster – and I hadn’t “used” it as most people use it in a long, long time. In fact, it became just another outpost to link blog posts that I wrote or that I liked. I hadn’t used it for social interaction (even with close family) for years.

Most simply, Facebook wasn’t providing any real value and I was certainly not providing much value in return. You could ask me what I thought about foot traffic (pageviews, clicks, referrals) via Facebook to my blogs and other properties and I’d say that although it was definitely a part of the overall traffic pattern it was beans comparatively to my other sources.

I’ll tell you one thing though, the mindshare (and mindsuck) of that social property has always weighed heavily and putting it aside has provided incredibly relief. What this does is free me up to be even better in fewer avenues. I’ve shared this strategy and tactic before about how focusing your efforts with one marketing channel is better than diluting your efforts among many.

In the end the internet world will keep on turning and FB won’t miss me much and I won’t miss the non-existent interaction that I’ve really had with it (and you won’t miss me either because I haven’t been very present in that space).

There are certainly some other reasons for which I’m leaving Facebook but those are neither here nor there for this blog post.

and it’s been quite apparent to me for quite some time that you are their product as they commercialize you and your work.

And sure, they’ve done it shamelessly but they’ve never been completely honest about it. Well, at least we can scratch off the last part now as they’ve unambiguously shared their intentions in their new updated policy.

Take a look at come to terms with this obvious fact: Facebook owns everything and if they could they’d take your soul too.

Their (Evil) Intentions For All To See:

Let’s take a look at their new policy, shall we? Now, for some context (and this is very important), this is by order of the judge who just walked Facebook through a large class-action lawsuit where Facebook was sued for using images and content of users for their advertising without consent or compensation.

Facebook loses class action lawsuit.
Facebook loses class action lawsuit.
Get this – they would even use and feature users who were under the age of 18 for their own monetary gain. You can read the full court ruling here.

So, a natural consequence of them not wanting to get sued again for such criminal activity is to make a new policy stating that every user will allow with full consent the social network to monetize everything that you are and that you do on their platform.

E.v.e.r.y.t.h.i.n.g.

Naturally, this includes your photos. This is why Pressgram is so necessary in such wicked times! And you know that Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, will eventually share the same policy in time (not if but when is the question).

What does their new policy essentially state? It means that Facebook can use your name, your likeness, and the content posted on your profile for advertising and “Sponsored Stories” without compensation. This also now includes and extends to minors.

This is what they have to say:

You give us permission to use your name, profile picture, content, and information in connection with commercial, sponsored, or related content (such as a brand you like) served or enhanced by us. This means, for example, that you permit a business or other entity to pay us to display your name and/or profile picture with your content or information, without any compensation to you.

If you are under the age of eighteen (18), or under any other applicable age of majority, you represent that at least one of your parents or legal guardians has also agreed to the terms of this section (and the use of your name, profile picture, content, and information) on your behalf.

What. The. Fuck… … … … ?!?

Not only that, it also gives more control by Facebook to use it’s facial-recognition software for photo tagging meaning that it could leverage your face and/or your friends and their faces to provide targeted marketing and advertising for everyone.

What does this mean? It means that Facebook could make it look like you are endorsing a product to your family and friends when you are actually NOT endorsing it at all – in fact, you may not even be aware of the product or service that’s being advertised!

Imagine discovering (via your friends and network) that you’ve been promoting a product or service that you hate or that might conflict with a personal belief or that perhaps is even fairly unsavory. Well, you’ve just given Facebook the right to do just that.

If all this isn’t enough then here’s some more stuff that Facebook has given themselves the right to do:

Facebook has the right to know what computer or device you’re using (iPhone, Android, Windows, etc.). This is so they can provide even more commercial opportunities based on your hardware (not just software anymore).
Facebook is allowed to track your GPS location so that that they can provide, at some point, a commercialized way of capitalizing on geo-location and your friends locally. Daily deals anyone? Yikes.
Facebook has the right to share your public information with others and other financially-motivated organizations. You can make that stuff “private” if you’d like but you’re still subject to the other policies. Besides, if you’re using Facebook “privately” you might as well boot up your own blog or use another less-commercial platform that won’t suck your soul.
Facebook is allowed to keep all data related to any application that you use, even if you delete that application, indefinitely and eternally. This also extends to the applications themselves and the organizations that run them. Whatever data you send whether you know it or not is theirs in perpetuity. Oh yay.
It’s clear folks – Facebook has stated plainly that they want to use you and all of that data (including all your media, photos, and more) to generate as much advertising income as they possibly can. They also want to grant rights to all those 3rd parties that they are partnering with as much access to your data as well.

To be completely honest (as I always am) I cannot walk away from their new policies feeling anything but sick, literally. Bile rises into my throat thinking about how shameless Facebook is with their motives.

How could you possibly trust Facebook or feel anything close to safe or secure with your data, your photos, your life? I shut down my usage of Facebook a while ago, perhaps it’s time you did the same (read the comments on their proposal by users just like you. Ridiculous!).

Or, at the very least, put your photos in the only hands that you can completely trust – your own. Hey, and that’s what we’re all about.
