Summer Fitness Goals

Over the past few months since the birth of my daughter, I have really slacked off with my fitness goals. All the progress I made during the fall has nearly been erased by poor eating choices and not hitting the weights.

This weekend my wife and I started doing Yoga together in the morning. 

Having the least physically exerting job of all time, I also decided to start taking breaks throughout the day in order to get some exercise. My lunch break is now a two-mile walk, and bust out a few push-ups and sit-ups every few hours. While some Muscle & Fitness zealot will try to complain about this hurting my gains, it isn’t like I’d be getting a whole lot of exercise otherwise.

I've decided rather than be mad about my job taking away my standing desk with the move to our new office, that I'd leverage the new location to my benefit. There is a trail along side the building that is about a half mile long. To the end and back is a full mile. We're also on the 5th floor. I plan to walk this trail 3 times every work day, getting in 3 miles every day. I'll also be going up the stairs 5 times a day. Once in the morning when I come into work, then 3 times as I go up the stairs from my walks, and a 4th time I'll go up 4 flights as I am parking on the top level of the parking deck.
