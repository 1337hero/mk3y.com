Here is a resolution for 2015...

**STOP READING/WATCHING THE NEWS!**

Read the news is a vicarious time waster similar to sports. 

Out of the thousands of news stories you have read in the past year, name one that –because you consumed it – allowed you to make a better decision about a serious matter affecting your life, your career, your business – compared to what you would have known if you hadn’t swallowed that morsel of news.

Can't do it can you? I didn't think so. And that's the reality I faced when I asked myself the above question.

Visiting Drudge Report 20 times a day does nothing but give me new things to complain about.

And if you need more reasons, here are 4:

1. **It Alters Your Brain:**

 Like the way porn rewires our brains to crave constant sexual novelty, news rewires our brains to crave constant informational novelty. I never felt the need for a Twitter account until a couple years ago. A few months ago I started checking it more often. Now I find myself compulsively checking it when I’m idle for a few moments. This is not healthy. Our brains acclimate to unnatural levels of stimulation and then demand them when they are absent.

2. **It limits your ability to reason**

 Becoming accustomed to the 30-second soundbyte prevents us from exercising the deeper analytical capabilities of our minds. Though most people fancy themselves expert multitaskers, true introspection on an idea necessitates concentration that a constant stream of news renders impossible. Some studies even suggest that consuming news makes us worse decision-makers.

3. **It is manipulative**

 The media used to planting ideas, often furthering the aims of equalism, feminism, and political correctness. Politicians and corporations alike use media campaigns to manipulate a public who considers it completely normal to spend several hours a day consuming news on their computers and televisions. The lack of context clues makes it difficult for the average person to detect whether a story has a particular bias.

4. **It's an unproductive time sink**

 Nothing you see on popular news is going to help you get healthy, make more money or better daily decisions. If anything it's just going to add stress.

 Mainstream news is in the habit of rehashing old things. Falsly reporting things and link baiting.

 The New York Times may begin singing the praises of intermittent fasting on a paleo diet in 10 years or so, but I’ll have a decade’s head start based on reading books, consulting with experts, and careful self-experimentation.

News fills your mind with wasteful thoughts without adding anything that will make you a more well-rounded, knowledgeable, or successful person.

**The solution?** 

STOP CONSUMING THE NEWS. Cull your Google reader, switch your homepage from NYtimes.com, and bring a book to the doctor’s office. You may just find yourself happier, sharper, and better equipped to dominate.
