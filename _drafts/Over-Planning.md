Over planning and trying to figure things out have been holding me back from accomplishing some of my biggest dreams. It's true, they say everyone needs goals and a plan to succeed. But sometimes I wonder if you really need a plan at all. How much of a plan do you actually need? And does planning or trying to plan out every detail hold us back from actually accomplishing our goals?

Up until my recent decision, I keep struggling with how I would make this work. I'm still not one hundred precent certain.

What is certain is my comfortable, yet unfufilling present situation. I have a steady job, that is pretty decent. Good coworkers and good pay. We have a nice house, 3 cars and a dog. We're living the american dream supposedly.

But something is holding me back. What we want is to travel. And to live a life on the road. How does one make that possible?

By just doing it. I have come to the conclusion that trying to solve every problem in the hope of avoiding failure is a mistake. I should expect and anticipate some failures. I don't need to know all of the answers.

While some planning is advisable it's ok if I don't have all the answers just yet. I shouldn't let the lack of hack all the answer hold me back from. Moving closer to our dreams.
