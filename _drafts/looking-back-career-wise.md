As much as I believe in the entrepreneurial spirit; sometimes the right job at the right time can teach you not just more about your profession but yourself.

In April I will have been employed with Wihp for the past 3 years while I've lived here in Florida. And as such I've recently been reflecting on my chosen profession.

In the ever charging career of the web, it's easy to think, why didn't I start doing this sooner? And that's been on my mind a lot lately.

### Looking Back

I've been tinkering with the internet since 1997. When I built my first GeoCities website to talk about Sim City 2000. 

A few years later in 1999 I began writing custom themes for LiteStep. And got involved with LiteStep community. I helped build and design Litestep.org with an individual named Warewolf79 (mysterous screen names where still a thing in 99). This was my first experience with php includes and .shtml files.

Sometime around 2002 I started h3rdgen.org - with vBulletin 2.1 - a local car club for owners of 3rd generation f-bodies. For those wondering, an f-body is the shared platform of GM's Chevrolet Camaro & Pontiac Firebird. 3rd Generation are model years 1982 thru 1992.

That lead to me building a vbulletin forum for the local Tidewater Trans-Am Club, and a friend who got out of the Navy and moved back to Bastrop County Texas, BCFbody.com.

It was also about this time I started my own website, but it was never much of beyond a glorified Myspace.

I ran H3rdGen as a hobby for a number of years, including building plugins for vbuelletin and being active on vbulletin.org (http://www.vbulletin.org/forum/member.php?u=19847)

I'm a little lost on the dates, but sometime around 2005 I opened up our club for fbody owners of all years, and we became HRFBODY.com. This was the first time I fully designed my own vbulletin.

The Christmas of 2005 Myspace was still raging and Facebook hadn't opened up to the world yet. I got the idea for my first true online business.

The idea born was 757forums.com - since I had success organically growing a local forum to 1000 members with about 25% active, I thought that I could grow a local forum that appealed to a wider youthful audience. 

It would focus on culture, nightlife and afterwork stuff. And it worked for several months. I figured as views and users grew, I could promote local bands for free and get local businesses and clubs advertise on the site.

This all worked, for 3 months, the site's membership grew organically, but I made one critical mistake.

I blabbed my idea to my competition. See in Hampton Roads we had two other large online car clubs. TidewaterRacing and SevenCitiesRacing.

The guy at SevenCitiesRacing, liked my idea, and had a forum with a much larger active audience. He rebranded over night, to SevenCitiesForums and then launched a campaign to talk about how my site was just to make money off of people.

The effect it had on my forum was the effect Facebook had on Myspace.

I had to grow and promote my site, but his site already had a larger membership, all they had to do was tell all their friends that they could use the site now.

Saddly, I gave up, threw in the towel and shut down my site. To my modern amusement, SevenCitiesForums.com never made any money, and shut down a year later.

The thing was, at the time, I had just came out of losing my job, being heavily in debt and moving back into my parents. So to try and start a business on my own and have it fail was kind of heart breaking.

I went back to just toying with the car club for the next two years.

Oddly enough it wouldn't be until 2009 after traveling the country with a friend that I decided I had enough of working for others and I was going to try and make a career out of web development.

At this point in time, I had become heavily involved reading blogs on 'Lifestyle Design' and entrepreneurship. Tim Ferris's had just released his book The 4 Hour Work Week. And while today I consider it mostly all hyperbole, the book was inspiring to a 26yr old who wanted to take over the world.

Social Media marketing was just coming into it's own, and I set down to build my business, and brand myself and go all in on a freelance career.
