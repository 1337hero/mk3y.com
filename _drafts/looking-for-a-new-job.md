Hi there,

 For the last 3 years I've been working for single company in Clearwater, FL.

## What kind of job am I looking for?

Three possible roles come to mind;

* “Front-end ops” or front-end development role.
* Product or front-end team lead.
* Full stack developer role

I’m not too biased to particular frameworks or languages, but I am interested in shipping real working software, to real people, every day. Launching projects is one of my favorite things, but I’m also really interested in how teams communicate and improve their craft as a group.

My wife and I have sold almost all our possessions to chase after our dreams. I’d like to to work remote, but I’m happy to check into “home base” when required.

## What kind of company am I looking for?

Ideally, I’d like to work with an established service or platform company that are growing, understand their market, and where they want to go.
