Your blog is a dynamic and living representation of you, your goals, your mission, your ideas, and more. You would never call yourself or your life “static,” right?

As such you should treat your blog with a little bit more care and become more than just a publisher of content – become a curator of your content!

What does this mean? Well the definition of “curate” and “curation” is as follows:

Curation is generally the selection of, care for and presentation of the objects entered into a collection, whether that collection is physical (such as items in a museum) or digital (such as entries in Wikipedia).
Makes sense, right? How does this apply to your blog? Here’s how:
